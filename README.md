# Deep-Neural-Network-and-CNN-using-Tensorboard-Visualizations
This repository is about the code of training and testing mnist dataset using keras and saving the checkpoints of each training through callbacks. 
Also the following method is used to visiualize the output of the models on tensorboard. 
You can now launch tensorboard with `tensorboard --logdir=./logs` on your
command line and then go to http://localhost:6006/#projector to view the
embeddings
